 Main Functionality

When you open the homepage (index.html):

1. The page loads with three clickable tiles:

Menu

Specials

Map



2. When you click on the "Specials" tile, it will:

Take you to a random menu category (like Lunch, Dinner, Sushi, Soup, etc.).

Show the list of items in that random category with name, description, and prices (just like previous module item pages).



3. If you click the restaurant logo, you go back to the homepage.


4. When you click "Specials" again, it loads a different category page (most of the time, since it's randomly chosen).






üì∑ Visual Description of Output:

Let me break down how it looks:

üè† Homepage:

+-----------------------------------------+
|           Our Restaurant Logo           |
+-----------------------------------------+
|   [ Menu ]   [ Specials ]   [ Map ]     |
+-----------------------------------------+

After Clicking "Specials":

Suppose it picks the "Lunch" category randomly:

+-----------------------------------------+
|             Lunch Menu Items           |
+-----------------------------------------+
| 1. Item Name  |  Description  | Price   |
| 2. Item Name  |  Description  | Price   |
| ...                                      |
+-----------------------------------------+

If you click again later, it might take you to the "Sushi" category instead, and show its items.
